Part 2 – Analyze your ArrayList
In the lab write-up:
 Fill out the following chart describing the Big O of each method you wrote in your MyArrayList class. Explain
and defend your answers by explaining the similarities and differences.
(“Because that’s what my neighbor told me it was” is not a good defense!)
 Sketch and label the Big-O algorithm runtime for each method.
Constructor O( 1 )
add(Object) O( n )
add(int, Object) O( n )
contains(Object) O( n )
get(int) O( 1 )
isEmpty() O( 1 )
remove(int) O( n )
remove(Object) O( n )
set(int, Object) O( 1 )
size() O( 1 )
