/**
 *	Use the main method of this class to test your MyArrayList methods
 *	as you write them.
 *
 *	You should implement the add(Object) and size() methods first. Below is a quick test
 *	to make sure that add(Object) and size() work properly.
 *
 *	As you implement more methods, write some code in this main method to make sure
 *	it works correctly. Be sure to test edge cases like 
 *		- "what if the list is empty"
 *		- "what if the list is not empty"
 *		- "does it work on the first element" 
 *		- "does it work on the last element"
 *		- "does it work on an element in the middle"
